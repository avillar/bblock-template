# OGC Building Block template

This repository can be used as a template to create new collections of
[OGC Building Blocks](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblocks). 

## Overview

This building block template is for definitions of reusable specification elements, typically OpenAPI components such as schemas, parameters and paths.

Using the repository design supported by this template allows building block definitions to:

- be gathered into registers (catalogs) for discovery and re-use
- to include other building blocks for re-use 
- be collated into composite specifications
- to be validated for completeness and correctness
- to be processed to generate documentation and complete examples

## Building block structure

- `metadata.json`: Contains the metadata for the building block. Please refer to this
  [JSON schema](https://github.com/avillar/bblocks/blob/master/metadata-schema.yaml) for more information.
- `description.md`: Human-readable, Markdown document with the description of this building block.
- `examples.md`: A list of examples for this building block. See [Examples](#examples) below.
- `schema.yaml`: JSON schema for this building block, if any. See [JSON schema](#json-schema) below.
- `assets/`: Documentation assets (e.g. images) directory. See [Assets](#assets) below.

This repository includes a sample building block in the `my-building-block` directory.

### Examples

Each example consists of Markdown `content` and/or a list of `snippets`. `snippets`, in turn,
have a `language` (for highlighting, language tabs in Slate, etc.) and the `code` itself. 

The `examples.yaml` file in `my-building-block` can be used as a template.

### JSON schema

The JSON schema for a building block can be linked to a conceptual model by using a root-level `@modelReference`
property pointing to a JSON-LD context document (relative paths are ok). The Building Blocks Register can 
then annotate every property inside the JSON schemas with their corresponding RDF predicate automatically.

If a `schema.yaml` file is found, it is not necessary to add the `schema` property to `metadata.json`; it will
be done automatically on the OGC Building Blocks Register. `ldContext` however, is not auto-generated. 

### Assets

Assets (e.g., images) can be placed in the `assets/` directory for later use in documentation pages,
by using references to `@@assets@@/filename.ext`.

For example, a `sample.png` image in that directory can be included in the description
Markdown code of a building block like this:

```markdown
![This is a sample image](@@assets@@/sample.png)
```

## How-to

1. Fork (or click on "Use this template" on GitHub) this repository.
2. For each new building block, replace or create a copy of the `my-building-block`.
   Note: **the name of the new directory will be part of the building block identifier**.
3. Update the building [block's files](#building-block-structure).
4. Replace this README.md file with documentation about the new building block(s).
5. Contact OGC and request that your new building block(s) be added to the official Register.

Note: building blocks subdirectories can be grouped inside other directories, like so:

```
type1/
  bb1-1/
    metadata.json
  bb1-2/
    metadata.json
type2/
  subtype2-1/
    bb2-1-1/
        metadata.json
[...]
```

In that case, `type1`, `type2` and `subtype2-1` will also be part of the building block identifiers.
